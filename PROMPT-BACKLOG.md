This repo contains base example of Ralph Wiggum autonomous agent technique. It's all based on PRD (project requirements document), which generated by /prd skill and exported to JSON format for agent loop in ralph.sh.

But I use a backlog CLI tool (see https://github.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md) for describing tasks and project workflow. And I want PRD to be expressed by this tool. SO instead one JSON file - the bunch of separates task file, which can be managed with backlog CLI.

For additional details about backlog see project-manager-backlog agent in claude config folder.

Let' think and plan how to implement this feature.
